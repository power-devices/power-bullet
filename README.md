# Welcome to the Power Bullet electronics repository

![REV1 board 3D model](https://github.com/power-devices/power-bullet/blob/main/production/rev1/board.png)

I teach power electronics and I want to provide my students the best experience possible. This is the reason I created this project. I intend to allow people to produce power electronics devices at an extreme low cost. This board required 4 layers, but this is no problem today due to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or other manufacturers.

So far, the project is divided into 3 pieces:

 1. Power supply: used to delivery power the other boards, it is compatible with mono-three phase up to 220 VAC
 2. Power bullet: a three phase h-bridge, simple as that
 3. Power brain F103: the main controller

# Disclaimer

I provide no warranty at all. Use it at your own risk!

# What will I find here?

You will find the design and production files. To edit the schematic/board you will need to install Kicad. I used version 7 to create this board.

# What can I do with this?

In this repository the board design and production files are stored. You are welcome to download/distribute it, use it, whatever.
